                <div class="swiper-wrapper">
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Jhon Snow</h1><br><h2>House Stark</h2><br><p>Jon Snow, born Aegon Targaryen, is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised alongside Eddard's lawful children at Winterfell. Jon's true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself, in order to protect him from those that sought the complete annihilation of House Targaryen.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Jaime Lannister</h1><br><h2>House Lannister</h2><br><p>Jaime Lannister, known as the Kingslayer, is the eldest son of Tywin Lannister and a member of the Kingsguard. Renowned for his swordsmanship, he earned his infamous nickname by killing King Aerys II Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, an act that tarnished his reputation. Despite his outward arrogance and ruthlessness, Jaime is deeply complex, struggling with his sense of honor and loyalty. His romantic and incestuous relationship with his twin sister, Cersei, complicates his personal and political life. Jaime's character evolves significantly throughout the series, especially after losing his sword hand, which forces him to re-evaluate his identity and worth. His relationship with Brienne of Tarth also reveals a more honorable and vulnerable side. Jaime's internal conflict and journey towards redemption make him one of the most intriguing characters in the series.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Tyrion Lannister</h1><br><h2>House Lannister</h2><br><p>Tyrion Lannister, the youngest child of Tywin Lannister, is known for his sharp wit, intelligence, and resourcefulness. Despite being despised by his father and sister due to his dwarfism and the circumstances of his mother's death during his birth, Tyrion rises to prominence through his cleverness and political acumen. He serves as Hand of the King to Joffrey Baratheon and later advises Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion's journey is one of seeking respect and proving his worth in a world that constantly underestimates him. He forms deep bonds with characters like Jon Snow and Bronn, and his actions significantly influence the political landscape of Westeros. Despite his often cynical exterior, Tyrion shows compassion and a desire for justice. His wit, humor, and moral complexity make him a fan favorite and a crucial player in the series' intricate power struggles.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Cersei Lannister</h1><br><h2>House Lannister</h2><br><p>Cersei Lannister is the only daughter of Tywin Lannister and one of the most power-hungry and manipulative characters in "Game of Thrones." As the Queen and later the Queen Regent, she uses her cunning and ruthlessness to secure and maintain power for herself and her children. Her intense hatred for her brother Tyrion and her obsessive love for her twin brother Jaime drive many of her actions. Cersei's ambition leads her to make numerous enemies and questionable alliances, including her destructive alliance with the Faith Militant. Despite her intelligence and strategic mind, her short-sightedness and paranoia often backfire, causing immense suffering for herself and those around her. Cersei's rise and fall from power are marked by personal tragedy, political missteps, and an unwavering determination to protect her family's legacy at any cost.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Joffrey Baratheon</h1><br><h2>House Baratheon (really?)</h2><br><p>Joffrey Baratheon, the eldest son of Cersei Lannister and her twin brother Jaime, is presented as the heir to the Iron Throne. Known for his sadistic and cruel nature, Joffrey's reign is marked by tyranny and brutality. His impulsive and vindictive behavior creates numerous enemies and alienates even his own family members. Joffrey's death by poisoning at his own wedding, orchestrated by Olenna Tyrell and Petyr Baelish, is a pivotal moment in the series. It leads to a power vacuum and further turmoil within the Lannister family, particularly affecting Cersei's grip on power.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Daenerys Targaryen</h1><br><h2>House Targaryen</h2><br><p>Daenerys Targaryen, the "Mother of Dragons," is the last surviving child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King." Initially an exiled princess, she rises to power by embracing her heritage and claiming her destiny. Throughout her journey, Daenerys frees countless slaves and amasses a loyal following, aided by her three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. Her quest to reclaim the Iron Throne is marked by both compassion and ruthlessness, culminating in her controversial destruction of King's Landing. Her story is a complex arc of idealism, power, and tragedy, ending with her assassination by Jon Snow to prevent further tyranny.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Arya Stark</h1><br><h2>House Stark</h2><br><p>Arya Stark is a fiercely independent and tomboyish girl with a strong sense of justice. After witnessing her father's execution, Arya embarks on a perilous journey across Westeros and beyond. She trains with the Faceless Men in Braavos, becoming a skilled assassin. Arya's list of people she intends to kill drives her actions, leading to significant moments such as the murder of Walder Frey and the Night King. Her quest for vengeance is balanced by her loyalty to her family. Arya ultimately decides to explore the unknown west of Westeros, seeking new adventures beyond the known world.</p></div>
                    <div class="swiper-slide"><h1>Sansa Stark</h1><br><h2>House Stark</h2><br><p>Sansa Stark starts as a naive young girl with dreams of becoming a queen. Her betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon leads her to King's Landing, where she witnesses the cruelty and danger of the royal court. Sansa endures significant hardships, including the deaths of her father and brother, and her forced marriages to Tyrion Lannister and Ramsay Bolton. Over time, she grows into a resilient and cunning leader. Sansa ultimately returns to Winterfell, plays a key role in reclaiming it from the Boltons, and is later crowned Queen in the North, demonstrating her transformation from a pawn to a powerful ruler.</p></div>

Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series and the HBO show "Game of Thrones."
